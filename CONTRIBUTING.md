# Contributing Guide

We use [`flowgen`](https://github.com/joarwilk/flowgen) to convert 
types from `typescript` to `flow`.
After automatic conversion is done we polish everything manually.

You can also use [`flow.org/try`](https://flow.org/try/) to validate your work.


## Maintaining multiple versions

We maintain different versions of libraries, so there might be cases when:

1. You need to update all versions of a single library
2. You need to update only a single version of a library

Take it in account.


## Style checks 

Later we will introduce stricter `eslint` rules to check `flow` types syntax.
